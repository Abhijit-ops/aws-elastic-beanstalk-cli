How to use this package:

"display" is a package that allows developers to display data in a compact, visually appealing
table. Essentially, a screen takes a table and some data (from a data_poller) and uses the draw method to draw the display.

See an example of a display by running eb health.
See another example of a display by running eb deploy --version (with no other params)

In order to create your own display, look at the examples in traditional.py and versions.py.
Then see how to instantiate your screen, data_poller, and table in the file deployops.py, method display_versions
Or you can see in healthops.py, method display_interactive_health

You can use this template to easily make your static display.

(To make a dynamic, updating display, look through screen.py and data_poller.py. Check out background polling in data_poller)
